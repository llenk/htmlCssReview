<!-- nice indentation. children are indented one tab/two spaces from their parent. easy to read -->
<!-- one tab/two spaces is a flame war -->
<!-- the html tag's children don't get indented bc convention. also to make things not too indented i guess -->

<body>
    <!-- this contains the actual stuff we display -->
    <p>html is the markup we're writing and the DOM is the current state. Kinda picky, but it's good to understand the difference.</p>
    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>html and css are the stuff we're writing, and they talk to javascript (ex)</p>
    <h1>HTML and CSS Review</h1>
    <h1>I'M THE LARGEST HEADING TAG</h1>
    <h6>i'm the smallest</h6>
    <p>when you write code, you have to make sure it looks good across all browsers</p>
    <p>different browsers show things differently, so we all hate safari i guess</p>
    <p>"I need a reputable news orginization"</p>  
    <p>"NPR?"</p>
    <p>"Okay, the Onion"</p>
    <p>At this point we learned how to change everything on the internet we wanted!</p>
    <h2>Things I Like</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="Activities">Naps</li>
        <li>Soup</li>
        <li class="Activities">Running</li>
        <li>Weekends</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: we created an ordered list, but didn't type the numbers, so if a browser decided they don't like the numbers, they could get rid of them. They decide how to display things.</p>
    <h2>Fast Things</h2>
    <ol>
        <li id="FirstPlace">Me running</li>
        <li id="SecondPlace">Me walking</li>
        <li id="ThirdPlace">Me sitting</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Selector Notes</h2>
    <h3>Ids</h3>
    <p>Write "id=" in the starting tag</p>
    <p>Use # at the front of the selector for ids</p>
    <p>Can only use an id once on an html class</p>
    <h3>Classes</h3>
    <p>You can use classes more than once.</p>
    <p>DIFFERENT FROM A JAVASCRIPT CLASS, which can get confusing</p>
    <p>If at some point, you'll have more than one of soemlthing on the DOM, use a class</p>
    <h3>Priorities</h4>
    <p>Under the hood, CSS assigns a point value to how relevant things are. Putting styling directly on the element (in html) is first place, then ids, then classes, then type.</p>
    <p>Alternately, you can put !important on an attribute in CSS to make it most important.</p>
    <p>Order in CSS does matter in a specific case. If you write the same thing with different properties twice, the one that comes last wins.</p>
    <p>The important thing is not to memorize the ranking, but remembering that there is a way to be ranked. And accept it.</p>
